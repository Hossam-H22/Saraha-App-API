# Saraha API

Welcome to the Saraha API project! This project serves as the backend for a messaging application, inspired by the popular "Saraha" concept, where users can send anonymous messages to others. The API is built using Node.js and Express, with MongoDB as the database. It also integrates Joi and Bcryptjs for validation and security, and Cloudinary for seamless media upload capabilities.

<br>



<a id="Authentication"></a>

## Authentication and Security
User passwords are securely hashed using Bcryptjs before being stored in the database. This ensures the confidentiality of user credentials.



<br>



<a id="Validation"></a>

## Validation
Joi is used to validate incoming data for user registration, login, and message sending. This ensures that only valid data is processed by the API.



<br>



<a id="Media_Upload"></a>

## Media Upload
The integration with Cloudinary allows users to upload media files, such as images, for their profile.
